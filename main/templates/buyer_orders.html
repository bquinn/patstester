    <h3><a href="{% url 'buyer_orders_create_with_campaign' %}">Send Order with Campaign</a></h3>
    <p>Helper page that lets you create a campaign and immediately send up to two orders on that campaign, all with one form. It also inserts campaign dates, publisher ID/name and campaign ID so you won't have to edit the order payload(s).</p>
    <h3><a href="{% url 'buyer_orders_create_raw' %}">Send Order (raw payload)</a></h3>
    <p>Basic form to send an order. You must enter the payload as a raw JSON string.</p>
    <h3><a href="{% url 'buyer_orders_create' %}">Send Order</a></h3>
    <p>This will be where we have a fancier form to send an order, but it isn't finished yet.</p>
    <h3><a href="{% url 'buyer_orders_list' %}">List Orders</a></h3>
    <p>List all orders with any activity since a given date/time.</p>
    <h3><a href="{% url 'buyer_orders_revisions_list' %}">List Order Revisions</a></h3>
    <p>We can view order revisions sent back to us, which is a start. A buy-side system would have to constantly poll this API to check for new revisions.</p>
    <h3>View order detail</h3>
    <p>Currently only linked from the order revisions list.</p>
    <h3>View order status</h3>
    <p>Tells a buyer whether their order was sent correctly. Linked from order revisions list.</p>
    <h3>Request order revision (broken - PATS-967)</h3>
    <p>Request a seller to revise an order, whether or not they have sent a revision. Linked from order revisions list and order revision detail page.</p>
    <h3>Return order revision</h3>
    <p>If you don't like an order revision you have received, you can "return" it to the seller. Linked from order revisions list and order revision detail page.</p>

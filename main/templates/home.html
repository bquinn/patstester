{% block content %}
    <p>This is used to run manual tests of the PATS platform.</p>
    <p>Use the navigation menu above to choose an API to test on either the buyer or seller side.</p>
    <h3>Updates on 23 March 2017:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added "link campaign" feature to link a seller-initiated proposal to a newly created campaign on the buyer side. (The workflow is: Seller sends proposal, Buyer creates campaign, Buyer links proposal to campaign, Buyer converts proposal to order, Buyer sends order to Seller, Seller accepts order)</li>
        <li>Add "view seller initiated proposals" in RFPs area on buyer side.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 20 July 2016:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added buyer-side products list and seller-side product editing/updating. See them via the "metadata" pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 23 May 2016:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added <a href="{% url 'seller_metadata_products' %}">seller-side products list</a> page to the metadata page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 18 May 2016:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added <a href="{% url 'seller_metadata' %}">seller-side metadata</a> page including "<a href="{% url 'seller_metadata_agencies' %}">view agencies</a>" from seller side and the new "<a href="{% url 'seller_metadata_mediaproperties' %}">view media property details</a>" metadata call.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 10 May 2016:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added a <a href="{% url 'buyer_events_list' %}">buyer events list</a> to see events coming in over the PATS Push API.</li>
        <li>Added a helper to the <a href="{% url 'buyer_orders_create_with_campaign' %}">create order with campaign</a> page to send a canned order payload. We have sample orders created from Brendan's unit tests and many of the UAT payloads. More test payloads coming soon.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 25 April 2016:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added a <a href="{% url 'buyer_rfps_create_with_campaign' %}">"create campaign and RFP"</a> helper page to make sending test RFPs in one shot easier.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 8 March 2016:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added basic OAuth2 handling and simple OAuth endpoint to receive pushes from the PATS Push API.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 1 March 2016:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed some attachment views and navigation between items.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 11 February 2016:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Updated RFP and Proposals screens to use the new 2016.1 APIs. Everything now works.</li>
        <li>Added robots.txt because somehow this site was being crawled by search engine robots!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 21 January 2016:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added a <a href="{% url 'line_item_tester' %}">prototype line item selector</a> based on a sample version of the "product catalogue" due to come out in the 2016.1 release.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 15 January 2016:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Fully updated for 2015.8 APIs - if there's something that doesn't work, it should be due to a bug in 2015.8. For example:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>PATS-1089   Buy-side API: Seller activity doesn't update last activity time on buy-side "Find orders" list</li>
        <li>PATS-1103   Buy-side API: Some buyType / buyCategory combinations fail</li>
        <li>PATS-1117   Sell-side API: "FREE" costMethod in revision causes 500 Server Error</li>
        <li><i><b>Note</b> on 11 Feb 2016: these are now all fixed</i></li>
    </ul>
    <li>You can now submit updates to campaigns.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 8 December 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Updated buyer-side calls for 2015.8 release. Everything should now work from the buyer side at least. I'm still looking at the seller side.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 16 September 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Added "view order revision status", new API included in 2015.6 release. Linked from View Order Detail page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 3 August 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Refactor of templates to remove lots of duplication. Not much to see except that the "view full order history" now looks a lot prettier (although it will take a while to load for big orders).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 22 July 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>We now support attaching files (well, one file) in creating RFPs. For attachments to proposals it's a bit trickier as we need to add them to raw payloads, but we'll make that work soon.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 16 July 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Added "Request Order Revision", linked from order revisions list on the buy side. It doesn't seem to work, though - logged bug as PATS-967.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 15 July 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Added "Return Order Revision", linked from order revisions list on the buy side.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 14 July 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Added "Create Order With Campaign" page to assist with acceptance testing. It creates a campaign and either one or two orders in one hit.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 13 July 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Added "order status" call on buy side.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 1 July 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>We now link to attachment downloads where possible on buyer and seller side. However both have bugs on the Mediaocean API side, so neither of them work right now. See bugs PATS-953 and PATS-954.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 30 June 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Fixed "curl" output quote escaping so you should now be able to cut and paste all curl commands.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that stopped "Send Order Revision" from working. Although I still can't get the API to work, I've raised PATS-949 about it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 29 June 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Added "respond to proposal" which handles a buyer "responding" to a seller's proposal with some comments. Linked from buyer-side "view RFP" pages.</li>
    <li>Added output of curl and raw JSON response to the bottom of each API call page. It's a bit untidy and only returns the last API call made, not necessarily syncing up with that page, so might give slightly odd results until I clean it up.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 26 June 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Added buyer-side View Campaign page, but it doesn't work due to bug PATS-939</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 25 June 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Send proposal now works, linked from View RFP and View Proposals pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 23 June 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Seller-side order history page now links through to "full history" with more info</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 17 June 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="{% url 'buyer_rfps_create' %}">Create RFP</a> now works</li>
    <li>Reorganised the index pages and added descriptions for most API calls</li>
    <li>Added empty listings for the calls we haven't yet implemented in the API tester</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 16 June 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Sellers can now "respond" to orders, ie "Accept" or "Reject" them, via the <a href="{% url 'seller_orders_list' %}">seller view orders page</a>. The Mediaocean API returns a 500 error, but it still works.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 15 June 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The simple <a href="{% url 'buyer_orders_create_raw' %}">create order</a> form now works - but you have to paste the JSON payload into a textarea so it's still quite clunky. Hopefully I'll have a better version working soon.</li>
    <li>You can now <a href="{% url 'buyer_campaigns_create' %}">create a campaign</a> using a web form</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Updates on 12 June 2015:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>You can now <a href="{% url 'configuration' %}">change the configuration parameters</a> either individually or using a preset configuration group, using the link in the top right corner of every page</li>
    </ul>
